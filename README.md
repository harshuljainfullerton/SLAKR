Inspiration - 
This app's inspiration was drawn from me forgetting about deadlines and everyday tasks. I always slack off and delay things to the last minute so this app was created to provide a space for procrastinators to unite and boost productivity.

What it does - 
Slakr provides a minimalistic view to add tasks in a todo list format. These tasks can be marked complete or incomplete. Tasks are stored locally to the users defaults, meaning exiting the app and relaunching it will ensure tasks to remain in the app. Along with this the Pomodoro timer allows users to set 25 min work periods with 5 min break periods to increase productivity. These timers release a 'ding' sound effect when complete and automatically switch to the next timer.

How I built it - 
This app was built in Swift/SwiftUI with multiple view pages and swift files along with a story board for the launch screen display that is shown when the app is first being booted up.

Challenges I ran into - 
Some challenges I ran into were: -Trying to automatically switch between 25/5 min timers -Trying to add and remove tasks from the list -Making numerous view pages to move from one page to another

Accomplishments that I am proud of - 
The timer automatically changing from 25 min to 5 min and vise versa -Adding and swiping to delete tasks in the list -Numerous functions that were made to make the code easier to read

What I learned - 
I learned a lot more about programming in Swift and SwiftUI and how to use numerous identifiers and functions along with parameters.
