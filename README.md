Inspiration - 
This app's inspiration was drawn from me forgetting about deadlines and everyday tasks. I always slack off and delay things to the last minute so this app was created to provide a space for procrastinators to unite and boost productivity.

What it does - 
Slakr provides a minimalistic view to add tasks in a todo list format. These tasks can be marked complete or incomplete. Tasks are stored locally to the users defaults, meaning exiting the app and relaunching it will ensure tasks to remain in the app. Along with this the Pomodoro timer allows users to set 25 min work periods with 5 min break periods to increase productivity. These timers release a 'ding' sound effect when complete and automatically switch to the next timer.

How I built it - 
This app was built in Swift/SwiftUI with multiple view pages and swift files along with a story board for the launch screen display that is shown when the app is first being booted up.

Challenges I ran into - 
Some challenges I ran into were: -Trying to automatically switch between 25/5 min timers -Trying to add and remove tasks from the list -Making numerous view pages to move from one page to another

Accomplishments that I am proud of - 
The timer automatically changing from 25 min to 5 min and vise versa -Adding and swiping to delete tasks in the list -Numerous functions that were made to make the code easier to read

What I learned - 
I learned a lot more about programming in Swift and SwiftUI and how to use numerous identifiers and functions along with parameters.

Project Description:

The project "slackr" is a task management application built using SwiftUI. It provides users with a simple and intuitive interface to create, manage, and track their tasks.

The application consists of three main components:

ContentView.swift: This file defines the main content view of the application. It displays a todo list where users can add, delete, and clear tasks. The list is dynamically updated using the @State property wrapper to reflect any changes made by the user. Users can also customize the appearance of tasks using the ListRowView component.

ListRowView.swift: This file defines the view for each task in the todo list. Each task is represented by an ItemModel object, containing a title and other relevant information. The ListRowView displays the task title and provides visual indicators, such as a checkmark, to indicate the task's completion status. Users can easily identify and interact with their tasks through this view.

ItemModel.swift: This file defines the data model for a task item. The ItemModel struct represents a task with its title. It serves as a blueprint for creating and managing task objects throughout the application. The ItemModel is used in ContentView.swift to store and display tasks in the todo list.

The "slackr" project demonstrates proficiency in SwiftUI, a modern framework for building user interfaces across Apple platforms. It showcases essential features of SwiftUI, such as state management, data modeling, and user interaction. The application offers a practical solution for organizing and managing tasks, providing a seamless user experience.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in developing user-friendly interfaces, implementing data models, and utilizing SwiftUI's powerful features. I successfully implemented core functionalities, including adding tasks, deleting tasks, and clearing the task list. Additionally, I employed user defaults to persist task data, ensuring that users can access their tasks across sessions.

Overall, the "slackr" project highlights my ability to create efficient and user-centric applications using SwiftUI. It demonstrates my strong skills in UI development, data management, and problem-solving, making it a valuable addition to my resume.
